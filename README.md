POC Source code for the XP Confirmation ID that uses hyperelliptic curves.
I attempted to reverse engineer this program quite some time ago, thankfully the source code was leaked.

**This isn't the cleanest code and looks like somebody else's disassembly work**. Let me know in the issues if you're the author of this god's work.
By the way, reversing virtual methods is abysmal.

**TODO: Cleanup the code.**
Compiled using v141_xp toolset, check releases for the executable.
